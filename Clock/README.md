# Clock with Tick Sound

This is a digital clock project with an interactive feature where you can hear a ticking sound every second. The clock's hands update in real-time, and a "Click the Button" feature allows users to play the tick sound manually. The project is mobile-friendly, so it looks great on all screen sizes.
